Budget Life, built using the Flutter framework, is an application meant to assist the user with managing both their money and their time. The app is directed towards young adults living by themselves potentially for the first time or people living on a tight budget. The appealing UI, the breakdown of your budget through different types of graphs, and the ability to add a reminder for something you need to pay for in the future are features of Budget Life that will be appreciated by all users alike. The ability to add objectives to the built in to-do list and the ability to record how often you get paid are standout features that make this app unique.
